# Introduction to Power BI Service

A basic understanding of Power BI is reccomended for this workshop.

*Estimated workshop length: 1 hour*

## Setup Instructions
This workshop requires access to the online version of Power BI known as Power BI service.  To access this platform you will need a microsoft account associated with your work or school.  If your organization uses integrated Office 365 (Brock University does this) then you will be able to log in with your institution credentials.

You will also need to install Power BI Desktop on your computer.  Keep in mind that Power BI Desktop is **not Mac compatible** so if you want to participate in this workshop you will need to use a windows computer or set up a windows environment on your Mac computer.  
  
If you do not already have the program you can get it by following these steps (keep in mind that you may need to contact your institution for permission to install programs):

- Go to the [Power BI Desktop download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494) and choose which language you prefer 
- Click the "Download" button and choose the installer that works for your computer  
- Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions in the setup wizard  
- With that you should be good to go!
